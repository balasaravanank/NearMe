            Kanniyakumari, located at the southernmost tip of India, is a beautiful coastal town in Tamil Nadu where the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal, and the Indian Ocean meet. It is famous for its stunning sunrises and sunsets, especially viewed from the Vivekananda Rock Memorial. The town is named after the goddess Devi Kanya Kumari, believed to be an incarnation of Parvati. A major pilgrimage site, Kanniyakumari also offers scenic beaches, historic temples, and cultural landmarks. Its unique geographical location and spiritual significance make it a popular destination for both tourists and devotees from across the country.
